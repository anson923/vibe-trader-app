## Puppeteer Implementation for Yahoo Finance Data Fetching

We've completely redesigned our stock data fetching mechanism by replacing Axios with Puppeteer to provide more reliable HTML parsing and direct data extraction from the Yahoo Finance website.

## Fixed Issues

1. **Resolved Navigation Timeout Error**:
   - Fixed the "Navigation timeout of 30000 ms exceeded" error
   - Changed URL format to `https://finance.yahoo.com/quotes/${ticker}/${ticker}/`
   - Switched from `networkidle2` to `domcontentloaded` for faster page loading
   - Increased navigation timeout from 30s to 60s for more reliable page loading

2. **Optimized Browser Configuration**:
   - Added additional Chromium flags for better performance in server environments
   - Added resource blocking for images, stylesheets, fonts, and media
   - Reduced memory usage through optimized viewport dimensions

## Key Changes

1. **Replaced Axios with Puppeteer**:
   - Installed and implemented Puppeteer for browser automation
   - Created a persistent browser instance that's reused across requests
   - Added connection checks to ensure browser is active

2. **Direct DOM Element Selection**:
   - Targets specific `<fin-streamer>` elements using DOM selectors
   - Extracts `data-value` attributes from elements for precise values
   - Formats change and percentage values to 2 decimal places as specified

3. **Simplified Request Flow**:
   - Removed single-ticker fallback mechanism as requested
   - Consolidated code into a single fetch function for all ticker scenarios
   - Added proper browser and page cleanup in all error scenarios

4. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Added explicit check for each ticker's presence on the page
   - Better logging with detailed success and error messages
   - More robust error recovery and fallback handling

## Files Changed

1. **app/api/stocks/route.ts**:
   - Complete rewrite using Puppeteer with optimized configuration
   - Fixed URL format to use the specified Yahoo Finance endpoint
   - Added request interception to block unnecessary resources

## Technical Details

The implementation now overcomes the navigation timeout issue through several optimizations:

1. **Resource Blocking**: Blocks images, stylesheets, fonts and media to speed up page loading
2. **Earlier Load Completion**: Uses `domcontentloaded` instead of `networkidle2` which waits for all resources
3. **Correct URL Format**: Uses the more reliable URL format for Yahoo Finance
4. **Better Browser Configuration**: Optimized browser launch arguments for server environments

## How to Test

1. Create a new post with multiple stock tickers ($AAPL, $META, $NVDA, $MSFT, $GOOGL)
2. Verify all stock data is fetched correctly without timeout errors
3. Check that the stock badges display accurate price, price change, and percentage change values to 2 decimal places
