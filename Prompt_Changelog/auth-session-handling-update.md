# Implement Authentication Session Handling

> Implement a function that if the cached session has no user session, then dont show create post button. Make sure to use @auth-context.tsx to get user cached session in local session. Make sure all other component when checking user auth session, is checking by this @auth-context.tsx AuthProvider to return the current local user session. Make sure no component is implementing its own check local session logic. All must be done in @auth-context.tsx

## Changes Made

1. **Updated `CreatePostButton` Component**

   - Modified to conditionally render based on auth status
   - Added 'use client' directive for client-side rendering
   - Now properly uses the AuthContext to check if a user is logged in
   - Button is hidden when no user is authenticated

2. **Enhanced `CreatePostPage` Component**

   - Added authentication check at component level
   - Uses useEffect to redirect to login if no user is logged in
   - Added loading state while authentication status is being determined
   - Prevents rendering the form if user is not authenticated

3. **Verified Auth Implementation Across Components**
   - Confirmed all components are using the AuthContext properly
   - No components are implementing their own authentication checks
   - All auth-related logic is centralized in the AuthContext provider

## Key Authentication Approach

- All authentication state is managed through the `AuthProvider` component in `lib/context/auth-context.tsx`
- Components access authentication state via the `useAuth()` hook
- Benefits of this approach:
  - Centralized authentication logic
  - Consistent user experience
  - Easier to maintain and update
  - Prevents duplicate/inconsistent authentication checks

## Components Using Authentication

The following components now correctly use the AuthContext:

- CreatePostButton
- MobileNavigation
- LeftNavigation
- PostPage/PostPageContent
- CreatePostPage
- ProfilePage
- LoginPage
- RegisterPage

## Next Steps

- Consider implementing a higher-order component or middleware to protect routes that require authentication
- Add user role-based permissions if needed
- Add remember-me functionality for improved user experience
