## Problem Overview

After migrating to a new database schema that uses a `tickers` array on the posts table and removes the `post_id` column from the stocks table, two issues were identified:

1. When creating posts with stock tickers (e.g., "$NVDA let go!"), the `tickers` array in the posts table wasn't being populated correctly.
2. Stock capsules weren't appearing in the feed page due to the missing tickers data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Post Creation Process (`app/create-post/page.tsx`)

- Removed redundant setting of the `tickers` array during initial post creation
- Let the `saveStockData` function handle all tickers array updates
- Simplified the post creation flow to ensure consistency in stock data handling

```jsx
// Before
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('posts')
  .insert([{
    // ...other fields
    tickers: tickers.length > 0 ? tickers : [] // Set tickers array directly
  }])

// After
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('posts')
  .insert([{
    // ...other fields
    // tickers will be set by saveStockData for each stock
  }])
```

### 2. Stock Data Saving (`lib/stock-utils.ts`)

- Enhanced the `saveStockData` function to properly handle the `tickers` array updates
- Added robust array checking to ensure `tickers` is always treated as an array
- Improved error handling and added detailed logging
- Always update the post's tickers to ensure consistency

```typescript
// Before
const currentTickers = postData.tickers || [];
// Only update if tickers changed
if (uniqueTickers.length !== currentTickers.length) {
  // Update logic
}

// After
const currentTickers = Array.isArray(postData.tickers) ? postData.tickers : [];
// Create a Set to ensure uniqueness
const uniqueTickers = [...new Set([...currentTickers, stockData.ticker])];
// Always update to ensure consistency
// Update logic
```

### 3. Stock Data Retrieval (`lib/stock-utils.ts`)

- Enhanced the `getStockDataForPost` function with improved logging and error handling
- Added proper checks to ensure `tickers` is always an array
- Added more detailed logging of the stock data retrieval process

### 4. Post Card Component (`components/post-card.tsx`)

- Added more detailed logging to track the stock data fetching process
- Added checks for empty data to prevent render errors
- Improved error handling with specific error messages

## Results

These changes ensure:
1. Posts with stock tickers (like "$NVDA let go!") properly store the ticker (NVDA) in the post's `tickers` array
2. Multiple tickers in a post (like "$NVDA and $AAPL lets go!") are all captured in the `tickers` array
3. Duplicate tickers are automatically removed via Set operations
4. Stock data is correctly fetched and displayed as capsules in the feed page

## Testing Steps

1. Create a new post with a single stock ticker (e.g., "$AAPL is on the rise!")
2. Create a post with multiple stock tickers (e.g., "$NVDA and $GOOG are my favorites")
3. Create a post with duplicate tickers (e.g., "$AAPL news and more $AAPL updates")
4. View the feed page and confirm stock capsules appear for all posts
5. Check the browser console for detailed logs of the stock data processing

## Technical Notes

- The tickers are extracted using a regex that looks for the "$SYMBOL" pattern
- A Set is used to ensure no duplicate tickers are stored
- The stock data is fetched once per ticker, making the system more efficient
- Debug logs have been added throughout the flow for easier troubleshooting
