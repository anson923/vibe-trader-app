# Fix Supabase Environment Variables Issue

## Changes Made
- Created `.env` file with placeholder values for Supabase configuration
- Created `.env.local` file with placeholder values for Supabase configuration
- Added required environment variables:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
  - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY

## Next Steps
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard (https://app.supabase.com)
2. Navigate to Project Settings > API
3. Copy the following values and replace them in your `.env.local` file:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`: Copy the "Project URL"
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Copy the "anon public" key
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: Copy the "service_role" key
4. Restart your Next.js development server

## Important Notes
- Keep your `.env.local` file secure and never commit it to version control
- The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` has admin privileges, so keep it secret
- The `.env` file serves as a template and can be committed to version control
