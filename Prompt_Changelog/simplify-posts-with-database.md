# Simplify Posts and Add Database Integration

This document outlines the changes made to simplify the post creation process and implement database storage for posts.

## Changes Implemented

1. **Create Post Page Simplification**
   - Removed "Stock Tickers" and "Hashtags" input fields
   - Removed "Add image", "Add chart", and "Add link" buttons
   - Simplified the post creation to use only plain text content
   - Connected post creation to Supabase database

2. **Database Integration**
   - Created a `posts` table in Supabase with the following structure:
     - `id`: Primary key
     - `user_id`: Foreign key linking to auth.users
     - `content`: Text field for post content
     - `username`: User's name
     - `avatar_url`: User's avatar URL
     - `created_at`: Timestamp
     - `updated_at`: Timestamp
   - Added Row Level Security policies for proper access control
   - Created indexes for optimized performance

3. **Feed Page Updates**
   - Removed hardcoded example posts
   - Implemented functionality to fetch posts from the database
   - Added loading state
   - Sorted posts by most recent first (created_at DESC)
   - Added an empty state for when no posts exist

4. **Profile Page Updates**
   - Modified to fetch and display only the current user's posts
   - Sorted posts by most recent first
   - Added loading state and empty state
   - Added a link to create a post when no posts exist

5. **PostCard Component Simplification**
   - Simplified to work with the basic post structure (no tickers, hashtags, images)
   - Removed stock info displays and related click handlers
   - Maintained the social interaction buttons for UI consistency

## Database Structure

The database SQL setup includes:
- Table creation with appropriate fields
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Indexes for performance
- Cascading delete to clean up when a user is deleted

## How It Works

1. **Creating a Post:**
   - User enters plain text content in the post creation form
   - On submit, the post is saved to the Supabase `posts` table
   - The user is redirected to the feed page

2. **Viewing Posts:**
   - Feed page loads all posts from the database, sorted by newest first
   - Profile page loads only the current user's posts, sorted by newest first
   - Each post is displayed using the simplified PostCard component

## Next Steps

For future enhancements, consider:
1. Adding post editing and deletion functionality
2. Implementing the social features (likes, comments, reposts)
3. Adding pagination or infinite scrolling for better performance with many posts
4. Adding rich text or markdown support for better post formatting
