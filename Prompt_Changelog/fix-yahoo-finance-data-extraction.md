# Fix Yahoo Finance Data Extraction

## Issue Fixed

The stock data extraction from Yahoo Finance was incorrectly returning zeros for some tickers (like NVD), even though the data was present on the page. This was happening because:

1. Yahoo Finance stores its data in different attribute locations depending on the page structure
2. The previous implementation was only checking the `value` attribute
3. Some tickers had their data stored in `data-value` or within the element's text content

## Implementation Details

### Improved Data Extraction

1. **Consolidated Data Extraction**:
   - Combined all data extraction into a single page evaluation to reduce Puppeteer calls
   - Added better logging of raw extracted data for debugging purposes

2. **Multiple Attribute Checking**:
   - Now checks three possible locations for the data:
     - `value` attribute
     - `data-value` attribute
     - Element's text content
   - Falls back progressively through these options

3. **Better Text Processing**:
   - Added handling for percentage values that include the '%' character
   - Added NaN checks to ensure we always return valid numbers
   - Improved error handling to provide fallback data when needed

## Testing

To verify this fix:

1. Create a post with the $NVD ticker (which was previously showing as $0)
2. Verify that the stock badge displays the correct:
   - Current price
   - Price change
   - Percentage change
3. Check the server logs to see the raw data being extracted
4. Confirm the data is saved correctly to the database

## Benefits

This change significantly improves the reliability of the stock ticker feature by:

1. Being more robust against variations in Yahoo Finance's HTML structure
2. Providing better debugging information in the logs
3. Successfully extracting data for tickers that were previously showing as $0
4. Reducing the number of Puppeteer calls per ticker, improving performance
