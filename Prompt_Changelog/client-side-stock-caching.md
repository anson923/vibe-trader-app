# Client-Side Stock Data Caching Implementation

This update addresses an issue where multiple identical stock data fetch requests were occurring for the same posts and tickers, resulting in redundant network calls and API requests.

## Issue

The logs showed that for a single post in the feed, multiple fetch requests were made for the same post ID:

```
Fetching stock data for post 63
stock-utils.ts:138 Fetching stock data for post 63 (using server-managed cache, no refresh checks)
post-card.tsx:76 Fetching stock data for post 63
stock-utils.ts:138 Fetching stock data for post 63 (using server-managed cache, no refresh checks)
```

These duplicate requests were occurring due to:

- React's strict mode that mounts components twice in development
- Multiple components requesting the same data
- State updates triggering re-renders

## Changes Made

1. **Client-Side Memory Cache Implementation**:

   - Added three in-memory caching mechanisms:
     - `postStockCache` - Caches stock data by post ID
     - `tickerStockCache` - Caches individual ticker data
     - `multiStockCache` - Caches data for multiple tickers

2. **Cache TTL Implementation**:

   - Added a 60-second cache TTL (Time To Live) for all cached data
   - Timestamp tracking to determine when cached data expires

3. **Enhanced Stock Utility Functions**:

   - Updated `getStockDataForPost()` with cache check and storage
   - Updated `getStockDataByTicker()` with cache check and storage
   - Updated `fetchMultipleStockData()` with cache check and storage
   - Added cache age logging for better visibility

4. **Cache Key Management**:
   - For multiple tickers, implemented sorted unique ticker lists as cache keys
   - For post stock data, the post ID is used as the cache key
   - For individual tickers, the ticker symbol is used as the cache key

## Benefits

- **Reduced Network Requests**: Duplicate fetch requests are now served from memory cache
- **Improved Performance**: Faster response times for repeated data requests
- **Better User Experience**: Smoother UI with less loading indicators
- **Reduced Server Load**: Fewer API and database requests
- **Better Visibility**: Cache hit/miss and age logging helps debug data flow

## Example of Cache in Action

Before this change, requesting stock data for the same post would result in multiple network requests. Now, the first request fetches from the network, and subsequent requests within the TTL window use the cached data:

```
// First request - network fetch
Fetching stock data for post 63 (using server-managed cache, no refresh checks)

// Second request - cache hit
Using cached stock data for post 63 (2.3s old)
```

## Next Steps

No additional actions are required. The client-side caching mechanism operates transparently and improves performance automatically. You may want to:

1. Monitor the console logs to confirm cache hits are occurring
2. Adjust the TTL (60 seconds) if you need different caching behavior
3. Consider adding cache invalidation triggers if real-time updates are needed in the future

## Update: Logging Improvements

To address issues with duplicate logs cluttering the console, we've implemented a comprehensive logging system:

1. **Centralized Logging System**:

   - Created a `logger` module in `lib/stock-utils.ts` that provides granular control over logging levels
   - Added support for log levels: `verbose`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `none`
   - Implemented functions to conditionally log messages based on the current log level

2. **Default Production Configuration**:

   - Set default log level to `error` in production to minimize console noise
   - In development, the default is also `error` but can be easily changed for debugging

3. **Component Integration**:

   - Updated all stock-related components to use the logger instead of direct console calls
   - Modified `post-card.tsx` and `post/[id]/page.tsx` to use the common logger

4. **Debug Utilities**:
   - Added `setLogLevel()` function to change log verbosity at runtime
   - Implemented `withVerboseLogs()` utility to temporarily increase log level for specific operations

This enhancement significantly reduces console noise while maintaining the ability to debug issues when needed. The feed page now shows only essential information instead of redundant log messages for the same operations.

To enable more detailed logging for debugging:

```javascript
import { setLogLevel } from "@/lib/stock-utils";

// Set to verbose during development
setLogLevel("verbose");

// Or just for error logging
setLogLevel("error");
```
