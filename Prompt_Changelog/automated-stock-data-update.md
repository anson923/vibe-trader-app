Set an array in nextjs server-side getting all these 200 stocks and ETFs to fetch yahoo finance every 15mins and when server deployed from @nextjs-server-side-top-200-stocks-and-ETFs.txt .
Make sure after update it, user no longer check the expiration time(15mins), when creating post, no more stock data expiration time validation and no more direct fetch from yahoo finance, and only fetch the stock table by using ISR in Next.js to cache server-side that refresh every 60 seconds (revalidate: 60), 15mins is for the yahoo finance to make sure data in stocks table are updated. combined with SWR on the client to handle local caching and occasional refetching. Add pagination to limit the data fetched per request. This reduces database hits, keeps the UI snappy, and scales reasonably well.

## Changes Implemented

The application now uses a background worker approach to automatically fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance every 15 minutes. This eliminates the need for direct Yahoo Finance API calls from the client and removes expiration time validation when creating posts.

### Key Components Added

1. **Background Worker (`lib/stock-batch-worker.ts`)**

   - Loads the 200 stocks/ETFs from the text file
   - Runs on a 15-minute interval
   - Processes stocks in batches to avoid rate limiting
   - Updates the database with fresh stock data

2. **Server Initialization (`lib/server-init.ts`)**

   - Starts the background worker when the Next.js server starts
   - Ensures proper initialization of the stock data cache

3. **NextJS Middleware (`middleware.ts`)**
   - Ensures server initialization happens on first request
   - Applies to all non-static routes

### API Improvements

1. **Updated API Routes**

   - `/api/stocks` - Uses ISR with 60-second revalidation
   - `/api/cached-stocks` - Provides paginated access to stock data

2. **Client-Side Changes**
   - Removed expiration time checks from `stock-utils.ts`
   - Modified `fetchMultipleStockData` to avoid unnecessary force refreshes

### Benefits

- **Better Reliability**: Stock data is updated on a consistent schedule server-side
- **Reduced API Calls**: No more direct Yahoo Finance calls from the client
- **Improved Performance**: ISR + SWR combination provides optimal caching
- **Scalability**: Pagination reduces database load and response size

## Edge Runtime Compatibility Fix

After implementing the automated stock data update feature, we encountered compatibility issues with Next.js Edge Runtime. The Edge Runtime doesn't support Node.js-specific APIs like file system operations (`fs` module) and process event listeners (`process.on`).

### Changes Made for Edge Runtime Compatibility

1. **Hardcoded Stock List**

   - Replaced file reading operations with a hardcoded array of stock tickers
   - Eliminated dependency on `fs` and `path` modules

2. **Runtime Specification in API Routes**

   - Added `export const runtime = 'nodejs'` to API routes that use Node.js features
   - Ensures these routes run in the Node.js runtime, not Edge Runtime

3. **Middleware Simplification**

   - Removed server initialization from middleware
   - API routes now handle server initialization when needed

4. **Improved Initialization Logic**
   - Added concurrency control to prevent multiple simultaneous initialization attempts
   - Better error handling and retry mechanisms

These changes ensure compatibility with Next.js Edge Runtime while maintaining all the functionality of the automated stock data update feature.

## Puppeteer Fetch Issues Resolution

We encountered navigation timeout errors when using Puppeteer to scrape stock data from Yahoo Finance. We implemented several improvements to make the stock data fetching more reliable:

1. **Browser Configuration Improvements**

   - Added more comprehensive launch arguments to Puppeteer
   - Set longer timeouts for page navigation and element selection
   - Used a realistic user agent to avoid detection

2. **Robust Retry Logic**

   - Implemented a system to retry failed requests up to 3 times
   - Added progressive delay between retries to handle rate limiting
   - Added validation to ensure fetched data is actually usable

3. **Fallback API Method**
   - Added a simpler direct API method as a fallback when Puppeteer scraping fails
   - Uses Yahoo Finance's query2 API which is more reliable but provides less data
   - Ensures we always get at least basic stock data even if scraping fails

These improvements greatly enhance the reliability of the stock data fetching system, especially in environments where browser automation might face challenges.

## Next Steps

1. No additional steps are required to use the new functionality. The stock data will be automatically fetched and updated in the background.

2. You can monitor server logs to see the background worker activity:

   - Look for messages like "Starting batch stock update process"
   - Each batch of 10 stocks will show processing messages
   - Watch for any "retry" messages which indicate the system is working through temporary issues

3. The cached data endpoints now support pagination parameters:
   - `page` (default: 1)
   - `pageSize` (default: 20)
