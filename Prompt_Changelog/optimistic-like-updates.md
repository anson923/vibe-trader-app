# For the comment like or post like api call, i would like to have user interface when user clicked the like button, show the red heart confirm first, and if any error that leads to unable to send like, then revert it.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Post Like Functionality (in both views)

Modified the `handleLike` function in:

- `components/post-card.tsx` (for post likes from feed)
- `app/post/[id]/page.tsx` (for post likes from post detail page)

The changes implement optimistic UI updates that:

1. Immediately update the UI when a user clicks the like button (show the red heart)
2. Save the original state in case of API failure
3. Make the actual API call in the background
4. Revert the UI if the API call fails

### 2. Updated Comment Like Functionality

Modified the `handleCommentLike` function in `app/post/[id]/page.tsx` to:

1. Update the UI immediately when a user likes a comment
2. Keep the original comments state to restore on error
3. Refine the UI with the exact server response if needed
4. Revert to the original state if the API call fails

## Benefits

- Much smoother user experience with immediate feedback
- No delay between user action and visual feedback
- Maintains data integrity by reverting when operations fail

## Next Steps

No additional steps required from you - the implementation is complete and working properly.
