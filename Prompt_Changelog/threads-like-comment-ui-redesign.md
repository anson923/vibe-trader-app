# Threads-like Comment UI Redesign

This document outlines the implementation of a redesigned comment section UI that follows the aesthetic and functionality of Threads.

## Overview

The redesigned comment section features a clean, modern interface with threaded conversations, progressive disclosure of nested comments, and improved user interactions. The implementation includes responsive design elements, infinite scrolling, and visual indicators for comment relationships.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Threaded Conversations with Progressive Disclosure

- **First-level replies** are shown with a collapsible toggle
- **Deeper nested comments** (level 2+) initially show only the first reply with a "View more replies" button
- Users can expand to see all replies at each level
- Comment threads maintain proper visual hierarchy with indentation

### 2. Collapsible Comment Threads

- Each comment thread has a collapse/expand button
- Shows the total reply count (including nested replies) when collapsed
- Preserves expanded state during actions like posting new comments

### 3. Visual Thread Indicators

- Vertical lines connect related comments in a thread
- Proper indentation based on nesting level (6px per level)
- Lines only appear where needed, creating a clean visual hierarchy

### 4. Like and Reply Counts

- Shows the number of likes for each comment with visual feedback
- Displays total reply counts (including all nested replies)
- Like functionality has optimistic UI updates for better responsiveness

### 5. User Interaction Features

- Like/unlike comments with visual feedback
- Reply to any comment at any nesting level
- Report inappropriate content via a dropdown menu
- Auto-expanding replies when adding a new comment to a thread

### 6. Responsive Design

- Auto-resizing comment input
- Clean spacing and layout for all screen sizes
- Proper typography sizing and weight

### 7. Infinite Scrolling

- Automatically loads more comments as the user scrolls
- Shows loading indicators when fetching more content
- End-of-content indicator when all comments are loaded

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management

- Uses React hooks for state management:
  - `expandedComments`: Tracks which comment threads are expanded
  - `page` and `hasMore`: For infinite scrolling
  - `activeReplyTo`: Tracks which comment is being replied to

### Performance Optimizations

- Progressive loading of comments with pagination
- Separate queries for top-level comments and replies
- Optimistic UI updates for likes and replies
- Efficient tree structure creation for comment threading

### Styling Approach

- Clean, minimal design with proper spacing and typography
- Subtle visual indicators for thread relationships
- Consistent button and interaction styling
- Mobile-friendly design considerations

### Data Structure

Comments are structured as a tree:
```typescript
interface CommentData {
  id: number;
  content: string;
  username: string;
  avatar_url: string;
  created_at: string;
  likes_count: number;
  liked?: boolean;
  parent_comment_id?: number;
  level?: number;
  replies?: CommentData[];
  totalReplies?: number;
}
```

## Usage Guidelines

### Commenting

1. Use the main comment form at the top to add a new top-level comment
2. Click "Reply" on any comment to respond to that specific comment
3. Comments automatically show threading with vertical lines connecting related comments

### Viewing Nested Comments

1. First-level replies show a "X replies" button when collapsed
2. Deeper nested comments show a preview of the first reply with a "View more replies" button
3. Click on these buttons to expand the thread and see all replies

### Other Interactions

1. Click the heart icon to like/unlike a comment
2. Click the three dots menu to report a comment
3. Scroll down to automatically load more comments

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. Comment editing functionality
2. Rich text and media embedding in comments
3. Comment sorting options (newest, oldest, most liked)
4. User mentions and notifications
5. Enhanced reporting options with categories

## Implementation Notes

The redesigned comment UI was built on top of the existing comment functionality while maintaining backward compatibility with the database structure. The implementation primarily required UI changes rather than backend modifications.

This redesign significantly improves the readability and usability of comment threads, especially for conversations with multiple levels of nesting, creating a more engaging and intuitive user experience.
